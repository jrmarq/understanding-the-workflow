      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m a software development student with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. I enjoy diving into new technologies and finding ways to use them to solve real-world issues. My journey in programming started a few years back when I joined a coding bootcamp, which opened the door to a whole new world for me.</p>
      <p>Outside of coding, I’m someone who loves to explore the outdoors, learn new skills, and connect with people. Whether it’s through hiking, reading, or working on personal projects, I believe in staying curious and open-minded. My goal is to continuously grow, not only as a developer but also as an individual who contributes positively to the community.</p>
      <p>Through my studies and work experience, I’ve come to realize the importance of resilience and adaptability. These qualities have helped me in my learning journey, and I’m excited to see where they take me in the future. I’m here to make an impact and <strong>build meaningful solutions</strong> that make a difference.</p>

      <h2>My Avatar: Alan Turing</h2>
      <p>For this project, I chose Alan Turing as my avatar. Turing was a mathematician and cryptanalyst who played a crucial role during World War II by developing a machine that could decode messages encrypted by the German Enigma machine. His work in breaking the Enigma code not only shortened the war but also laid the foundation for modern computer science.</p>
      <p>I admire Turing for his groundbreaking contributions to technology and his unwavering dedication to his work, even in the face of personal challenges. His story serves as a reminder that <em>persistence and innovation</em> can change the course of history. In a way, Turing’s legacy inspires my own journey in tech—his work on early computers shows me that with determination, even the most complex problems can be solved.</p>
      <p>In my studies, I often think about how Turing approached problems: analytically and creatively. His impact goes beyond his time, and his work remains a guiding light for anyone who dares to push the boundaries of what’s possible in technology.</p>

      <h2>Web Development Journey</h2>
      <p>Currently, I am enrolled in a course that is helping me master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the foundational skills for any aspiring web developer, and I’m eager to apply them in building functional and user-friendly websites. I’ve been introduced to semantic HTML5, which helps organize content effectively and ensures that web pages are accessible and readable.</p>
      <p>This class has also emphasized the importance of well-structured code. Using the HTML Validator, I’ve learned to check my code for errors and ensure it adheres to standards. It’s fascinating how simple tags and attributes can transform a page, making it interactive and visually appealing.</p>
      <p>One of my main goals is to develop a comprehensive understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and eventually move on to more advanced frameworks. I am committed to creating projects that not only meet requirements but are also crafted with attention to detail and a user-centric approach. Every step in this journey feels like a new chapter in my story.</p>
